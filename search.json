This data collection was instrumental in performing detailed quantitative analysis, which included developing comprehensive visualizations to present our findings effectively. My observational studies of educational interactions between older adults and their educators further informed the development of social support paradigms tailored to this demographic.\nA significant part of my work was the creation and coding of the CALM Model. This model integrates strategies to facilitate a supportive environment, engage lifestyle activities, modify resources, and enable intercommunication. These strategies aim to enhance the daily lives of older adults, helping them feel more connected and autonomous.\nI solely drafted the entire paper, ensuring it maintained clarity, coherence, and academic rigor throughout. My efforts included developing codes based on Positive and Negative Engagement criteria from previous research, designing parallel surveys for older adults and their younger family members, and analyzing the collected data to generate themes for technological intervention.\nMy work also involved visualizing data to understand the homogeneity of the response pool and the mapping of self-reported metrics to engagement categories. I developed and implemented the technological intervention strategies within the CALM Model, focusing on collaboration, autonomy, learning, and mental well-being. Every aspect of the project, from initial conception and design to data collection, analysis, and final documentation, was executed by me.

This review covered various aspects of aging, family dynamics, and the psychological well-being of senior citizens, with a particular focus on the concepts of dignity and self-fulfillment. I then conceptualized the research design, which involved redefining positive and negative engagement in the context of elderly family settings. I identified and defined various aspects of engagement and analyzed their impact on the dignity and psychology of senior citizens. The research hypothesized that self-fulfillment and the feeling of being wanted are crucial for the aging population and directed the study along these lines.\nAdditionally, I explored the role of technology in restoring the dignity of the elderly, examining how technological interventions can improve interactions between senior citizens and their families. I developed methods to understand the mindset of the aging population and what the concept of “Aging Well” means to them.\nTo support this theoretical study, I generated a taxonomy of key aspects of engagement and proposed a model for applying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to restore dignity. This model includes all critical factors that affect the concept of dignity and are essential for successful implementation. Furthermore, I designed surveys and interviews to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from senior citizens and their family members. These data collection methods aimed to provide insights into the experiences, needs, and expectations of the elderly regarding familial support and engagement.\nThe analysis and anticipated results were meticulously documented, and a comprehensive model was proposed based on the findings. This model aims to use HCI as a tool to enhance the engagement of senior citizens, reduce isolation, and promote their dignity through increased family interactions."
