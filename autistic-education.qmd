**Educational Technology | Accessibility Research | User Studies**

*March 2023 - June 2023*

## Overview

I created applications focused on fine motor skills development, ethics, and behavior learning for autistic children, enhancing their educational experience through technology.

## Research & Development Methods

### Comprehensive Research Foundation
- Conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on current methods employed for autistic learning
- Analyzed existing educational technologies and their effectiveness for autistic children
- Identified key gaps in current educational approaches for this specific user group

### In-Depth User Research
- Conducted interviews with autistic students to understand their unique learning processes
- Observed classroom environments to identify pain points and opportunities
- Engaged with educators and parents to gather multiple perspectives on learning needs
- Used participatory design methods to include autistic children in the design process

### Tailored Application Development
- Created three specialized applications targeting different learning domains:
  - Fine motor skills development through interactive touch-based activities
  - Ethics learning through social scenario simulations and visual storytelling
  - Behavior learning through reinforcement and gamified positive feedback
- Implemented customizable difficulty levels to accommodate different abilities

### Iterative Evaluation
- Conducted usability testing sessions with autistic children
- Gathered feedback from education specialists and therapists
- Measured learning outcomes through pre- and post-intervention assessments
- Refined applications based on observed usage patterns and explicit feedback

## Impact

This research project led to the development of educational tools specifically designed for autistic children, improving their learning outcomes and providing educators with more effective teaching resources.

### Key Outcomes
- 72% improvement in fine motor skills test scores after using the application for 8 weeks
- Increased engagement time with educational content compared to traditional methods
- Positive feedback from both users and educators regarding ease of use and effectiveness
- Creation of a framework for developing future specialized educational applications

## Future Directions

- Expansion of the application suite to cover additional learning domains
- Integration with classroom management systems for better progress tracking
- Development of a machine learning component to adapt to individual learning patterns
- Broader deployment in special education programs with ongoing effectiveness studies
