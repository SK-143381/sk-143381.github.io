##  “Is that my reflection?”‑ An Affect‑Aware Intelligent Mirror Employing Enhanced Conversational Contextualization

[SUBMITTED TO IEEE ACCESS] <br>

I originated the project idea and was solely responsible for writing the entire manuscript, ensuring comprehensive coverage and clarity in presenting the research findings. I conceptualized and engineered the smart mirror, integrating a voice agent that pioneers mood analysis through emotion recognition and speech feature analysis using Python, JavaScript, and Node.js. Additionally, I implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for speech analysis, which feeds into a novel Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithm based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This algorithm dynamically responds to fluctuations in five user emotions.

I orchestrated the technical creation and empirical research, devising the conversational interface and examining the interplay between emotion recognition, cognitive engagement, and attention metrics. A significant aspect of my work was the integration of the Mistral and LLaMA-uncensored models into the emotion agent, enabling it to cater to a diverse spectrum of emotions and provide low-risk advice for mood alleviation. Despite its strong capacity to succinctly motivate users, the system is currently prone to hallucinations, particularly in providing information related to user hobbies, which I am actively working to eliminate.

Furthermore, I introduced eye-tracking technology to measure users' attention and distraction levels while interacting with the conversational agent. Participants engaged in solving arithmetic problems, where they had to visually indicate the correct answer among two presented numbers. I meticulously measured response times to the conversational agent, problem-solving times, and accuracy rates, developing a normalized attention metric algorithm based on these measurements. My ongoing work involves conducting information behavior studies to refine user interaction with the mirror, leveraging insights from initial pilot studies and the wizard of oz technique.
