## About Me

I am Sanchita Kamath, a dedicated Human-Computer Interaction specialist and researcher. Over the years, I have focused on enhancing accessibility and inclusivity through innovative technological solutions. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my extensive body of work, ongoing research, and publications.

My research interests span various aspects of Human-Computer Interaction, with a particular emphasis on creating accessible technologies for individuals with disabilities. I am passionate about designing and implementing immersive technologies to aid the blind and visually impaired, and I have made significant contributions in this field. My studies also cover user experience design, privacy concerns in smart environments, and the development of inclusive user interfaces.

Not only am I a researcher, but I am also a mentor and educator. I have had the honor of guiding many students and young professionals in Design Thinking and Software Development. My teaching style is engaging and accessible, encouraging students to think critically and creatively about the challenges and opportunities in technology design.

On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, conference papers, and projects. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be presenting. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work and contributions to the field of Human-Computer Interaction.
