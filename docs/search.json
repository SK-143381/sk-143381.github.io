    "text": "Engagement of Senior Citizens in a Family Setting to Help Revive Dignity: A Study\nScitePress Article\nI began with an extensive literature review to provide a robust theoretical foundation for the study. This review covered various aspects of aging, family dynamics, and the psychological well-being of senior citizens, with a particular focus on the concepts of dignity and self-fulfillment. I then conceptualized the research design, which involved redefining positive and negative engagement in the context of elderly family settings. I identified and defined various aspects of engagement and analyzed their impact on the dignity and psychology of senior citizens. The research hypothesized that self-fulfillment and the feeling of being wanted are crucial for the aging population and directed the study along these lines.\nAdditionally, I explored the role of technology in restoring the dignity of the elderly, examining how technological interventions can improve interactions between senior citizens and their families. I developed methods to understand the mindset of the aging population and what the concept of “Aging Well” means to them.\nTo support this theoretical study, I generated a taxonomy of key aspects of engagement and proposed a model for applying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to restore dignity. This model includes all critical factors that affect the concept of dignity and are essential for successful implementation. Furthermore, I designed surveys and interviews to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from senior citizens and their family members. These data collection methods aimed to provide insights into the experiences, needs, and expectations of the elderly regarding familial support and engagement.\nThe analysis and anticipated results were meticulously documented, and a comprehensive model was proposed based on the findings. This model aims to use HCI as a tool to enhance the engagement of senior citizens, reduce isolation, and promote their dignity through increased family interactions."

    "text": "About Me\nI am Sanchita Kamath, a dedicated Human-Computer Interaction specialist and researcher. Over the years, I have focused on enhancing accessibility and inclusivity through innovative technological solutions. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my extensive body of work, ongoing research, and publications.\nMy research interests span various aspects of Human-Computer Interaction, with a particular emphasis on creating accessible technologies for individuals with disabilities. I am passionate about designing and implementing immersive technologies to aid the blind and visually impaired, and I have made significant contributions in this field. My studies also cover user experience design, privacy concerns in smart environments, and the development of inclusive user interfaces.\nNot only am I a researcher, but I am also a mentor and educator. I have had the honor of guiding many students and young professionals in Design Thinking and Software Development. My teaching style is engaging and accessible, encouraging students to think critically and creatively about the challenges and opportunities in technology design.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, conference papers, and projects. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be presenting. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work and contributions to the field of Human-Computer Interaction.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
