<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-that-my-reflection-an-affectaware-intelligent-mirror-employing-enhanced-conversational-contextualization">“Is that my reflection?”‑ An Affect‑Aware Intelligent Mirror Employing Enhanced Conversational Contextualization</h2>
<p>[SUBMITTED TO IEEE ACCESS] <br></p>
<p>I originated the project idea and was solely responsible for writing the entire manuscript, ensuring comprehensive coverage and clarity in presenting the research findings. I conceptualized and engineered the smart mirror, integrating a voice agent that pioneers mood analysis through emotion recognition and speech feature analysis using Python, JavaScript, and Node.js. Additionally, I implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for speech analysis, which feeds into a novel Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithm based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This algorithm dynamically responds to fluctuations in five user emotions.</p>
<p>I orchestrated the technical creation and empirical research, devising the conversational interface and examining the interplay between emotion recognition, cognitive engagement, and attention metrics. A significant aspect of my work was the integration of the Mistral and LLaMA-uncensored models into the emotion agent, enabling it to cater to a diverse spectrum of emotions and provide low-risk advice for mood alleviation. Despite its strong capacity to succinctly motivate users, the system is currently prone to hallucinations, particularly in providing information related to user hobbies, which I am actively working to eliminate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I introduced eye-tracking technology to measure users’ attention and distraction levels while interacting with the conversational agent. Participants engaged in solving arithmetic problems, where they had to visually indicate the correct answer among two presented numbers. I meticulously measured response times to the conversational agent, problem-solving times, and accuracy rates, developing a normalized attention metric algorithm based on these measurements. My ongoing work involves conducting information behavior studies to refine user interaction with the mirror, leveraging insights from initial pilot studies and the wizard of oz technique.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="engagement-of-senior-citizens-in-a-family-setting-to-help-revive-dignity-a-study">Engagement of Senior Citizens in a Family Setting to Help Revive Dignity: A Study</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2022/110748/110748.pdf" target="_blank">ScitePress Article</a><br></p>
<p>I began with an extensive literature review to provide a robust theoretical foundation for the study. This review covered various aspects of aging, family dynamics, and the psychological well-being of senior citizens, with a particular focus on the concepts of dignity and self-fulfillment. I then conceptualized the research design, which involved redefining positive and negative engagement in the context of elderly family settings. I identified and defined various aspects of engagement and analyzed their impact on the dignity and psychology of senior citizens. The research hypothesized that self-fulfillment and the feeling of being wanted are crucial for the aging population and directed the study along these lines.</p>
<p>Additionally, I explored the role of technology in restoring the dignity of the elderly, examining how technological interventions can improve interactions between senior citizens and their families. I developed methods to understand the mindset of the aging population and what the concept of “Aging Well” means to them.</p>
<p>To support this theoretical study, I generated a taxonomy of key aspects of engagement and proposed a model for applying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to restore dignity. This model includes all critical factors that affect the concept of dignity and are essential for successful implementation. Furthermore, I designed surveys and interviews to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from senior citizens and their family members. These data collection methods aimed to provide insights into the experiences, needs, and expectations of the elderly regarding familial support and engagement.</p>
<p>The analysis and anticipated results were meticulously documented, and a comprehensive model was proposed based on the findings. This model aims to use HCI as a tool to enhance the engagement of senior citizens, reduce isolation, and promote their dignity through increased family interactions.</p>
